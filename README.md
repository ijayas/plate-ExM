# plate-ExM resources
This page links the resources for adopting 3D printable ExM microplates for 4x expansion microscopy and distortion tracking through pre- and post-ExM analysis.

You can download the Fusion 360 CAD files for the plate, the lid, and the silicone rubber inserts from Links: [plate+lid](https://a360.co/40CkanE/) and [inserts](https://a360.co/40CkanE/).



The remaining data files that include 3D printer STL files, distortion analysis and plotting code, and ImageJ macros at the Zenodo [repository](https://zenodo.org/records/8381689)
